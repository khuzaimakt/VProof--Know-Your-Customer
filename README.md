# VProof - Know Your Customer (KYC)

**VProof** is an AI-powered customer verification application designed to streamline and automate the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. It performs liveness detection, document data extraction, and facial verification to ensure identity authenticity with high accuracy.

## üîç Overview

This project includes a modular backend engine built using **FastAPI**, located in the `model-server` directory. It provides the following core functionalities:

1. **Liveness & Anti-Spoofing Detection**
   - Ensures the uploaded selfie is from a real, live person and not a spoof (e.g., photo or video replay).
   - Utilizes **YOLOv8** for real-time face and spoof detection.

2. **Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
   - Extracts key identity information (e.g., name, DOB, ID number) from uploaded documents such as:
     - National ID Cards
     - Passports
     - Driver‚Äôs Licenses
   - Uses OCR techniques to convert document images into structured data.

3. **Face Matching / Identity Verification**
   - Compares the user's uploaded selfie with the face image from the identity document.
   - Employs **DLib** facial recognition to confirm both images belong to the same person.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the backend server locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `git` installed on your machine
- (Optional) `virtualenv` for isolated environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vproof-kyc.git
cd vproof-kyc/model-server

```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  

```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 4. Run the FastAPI server
```bash
cd model-server
uvicorn combined_api:app --reload

```

### 5. Run the FastAPI server
```bash
cd model-server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Once the server is running navigate to: http://localhost:8000/docs


## üì¶ Features

- **Liveness & Anti-Spoofing Detection**  
  Detects whether the uploaded selfie is of a live person and not a spoof (e.g., printed image or screen replay).  
  Implemented using YOLOv8 for real-time face and spoof detection.

- **Document OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
  Extracts structured identity information from images of official documents such as ID cards, passports, and driver‚Äôs licenses.  
  Useful for automating form filling and data validation processes.

- **Face Matching / Identity Verification**  
  Compares the user‚Äôs selfie with the photo extracted from the identity document.  
  Uses DLib‚Äôs face recognition to validate if both images are of the same individual.

- **Modular Architecture**  
  Backend is modular and easy to extend. Components like OCR, face detection, and matching can be swapped or upgraded independently.

- **Interactive REST API**  
  Clean and well-documented FastAPI interface with built-in Swagger UI for testing endpoints directly from the browser.
